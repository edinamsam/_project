Good — this is a very common Vercel + React Router issue.

That 404: NOT_FOUND means:

Vercel is trying to load /projects or /contact as a real file…
but your app is a Single Page Application (SPA).

React Router handles routing in the browser, not on the server.

So when you refresh a page like:

your-portfolio.vercel.app/projects

Vercel looks for:

/projects/index.html

It doesn’t exist → 404.

✅ The Fix (SPA Rewrite Rule)

You need to tell Vercel:

“For ANY route, always serve index.html.”

Step 1 — Create vercel.json in your project root

Make sure it is in the root, not inside src.

portfolio/
  ├── src/
  ├── package.json
  ├── vercel.json  ✅ HERE
Step 2 — Add This EXACT Content
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
Step 3 — Commit & Push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SPA routing for Vercel"
git push

Vercel will automatically redeploy.

⚠ If It Still 404s

Check these things carefully:

1️⃣ Is vercel.json really in root?

Wrong:

src/vercel.json ❌

Correct:

vercel.json ✅
2️⃣ Are you using BrowserRouter?

Make sure in your main.jsx:

import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom"

<BrowserRouter>
  <App />
</BrowserRouter>

NOT:

HashRouter
3️⃣ Did the build succeed?

On Vercel dashboard:

Check Build Logs

Make sure no errors occurred

🔥 Alternative (If You Want Zero Config)

Switch to HashRouter:

import { HashRouter } from "react-router-dom"

Then your URLs look like:

your-portfolio.vercel.app/#/projects

No rewrites needed.

But it looks less clean.

🎯 Most Likely Issue

99% of the time:

👉 vercel.json is either missing
👉 or placed inside src
