✅ How to preview changes locally (THIS is what you should use)
🔹 Step 1: Start the dev server

In your project folder, run:

npm run dev


Vite will show something like:

Local: http://localhost:5173/

🔹 Step 2: Open the app in your browser

Open:

http://localhost:5173

🔹 Step 3: Edit your code

Now:

Open your code editor

Change JSX, CSS, logic

Save the file

🎉 The browser updates automatically (Hot Module Reload).

No refresh needed.

🔥 This is called Hot Reloading

Vite does:

Watches your files

Rebuilds only what changed

Injects updates into the browser

That’s why Vite is fast.

❌ When you need to push to GitHub / Vercel

You only push when:

You’re happy with the change

You want it live online

You want to save a milestone

Workflow:

Edit → Save → Preview locally → Commit → Push → Deploy


NOT:

Edit → Push → Check production

🧪 Example real workflow (recommended)

npm run dev

Make changes

See them instantly at localhost

Fix bugs

When done:

git add .
git commit -m "Improve validation UX"
git push


Vercel redeploys automatically.

🚨 Common mistake (avoid this)

❌ Stopping dev server and refreshing production to see changes
❌ Pushing every small change just to “see if it works”

Always preview locally first.

🧠 Bonus: Preview production build locally

If you want to test exactly what production sees:

npm run build
npm run preview


This runs the built app locally.

🎯 Key takeaway

Local dev server = instant preview
Production deploy = final publishing

You should spend 90% of your time in local dev.
